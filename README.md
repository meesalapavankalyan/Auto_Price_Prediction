# ðŸš— Auto Price Prediction 

This project involves data analysis and predictive modeling to estimate car prices based on various features like engine size, horsepower, fuel type, and more. It is developed as part of the PRCP-1017 Capstone Project.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

- Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given car dataset.
- Build a predictive model using machine learning techniques to predict the price of a car based on its features.
- Help management understand how different features influence pricing for strategic decision-making.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Encoding and Scaling
- Model Training: Linear Regression & Random Forest
- Feature Importance Visualization
- Model Performance Evaluation
- Final Recommendations

## ðŸ“ˆ Results Summary

- **Best Model:** Random Forest
- **Top Influencing Features:** Engine Size, Horsepower, Curb Weight
- **Insights:** Luxury brands like BMW, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz have significantly higher prices. Certain features strongly correlate with price and can be used to optimize product design.

## ðŸ§  Challenges Faced

- Handling missing values in numerical and categorical fields.
- Encoding categorical variables efficiently.
- Balancing feature scaling and interpretability.
- Avoiding model overfitting and ensuring good generalization.

## ðŸ§¾ Final Notes

This notebook combines all tasks into a single workflow and is suitable for final project submission.
