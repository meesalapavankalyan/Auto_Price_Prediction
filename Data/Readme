🚗 1985 Auto Imports Dataset – Machine Learning Project
📌 Project Title
Auto Imports Price Prediction using Machine Learning

📄 Description
This project focuses on building a regression model to predict the price of automobiles using various characteristics of imported vehicles from the 1985 dataset.

The dataset includes technical specifications, insurance risk factors, and relative loss values, offering a rich ground for exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling using machine learning techniques.
